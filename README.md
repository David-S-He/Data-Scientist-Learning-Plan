# Data-Scientist-Learning-Plan
A Data Scientist Learning Plan to not only prepare for interviews, but to become a world class Data Scientist

Now that I've finished Galvanize's Data Science Immersive Program, this is my plan to continue my development as a Data Scientist, not just for interviews, but for my skillset as a whole. But because $$$ is important to live, my short-term focus will be on preparing for the Data Scientist interviews. Once I find the right fit, the plan will shift towards a life-long learning approach towards Data Science.

And in order to continue self-educating myself, a solid plan is very important. 

## Goal: Find a good-fit between myself and a company's Data Science team.

# Requirements:
Get an offer
Pass on-site interviews
Pass take-home examination
